# Calculator

## A Project in Computer Programming 101

### The calculator must have the following simple functions:
- Numeric keypad (0-9) with decimal point
- Can perform addition (+) , subtraction (-), multiplication (x), and division (%).
- Capable of chaining multiple operations together (with or without parenthesis) and it must execute them in the correct order.
- A delete button that deletes one character at a time
- A clear button that deletes everything that is written on the screen

### Other functionality goals for the project:
- Can solve trigonometric operations (sine, cosine, tangent, and its inverses).
- Can solve other algebraic operations (square root, squared, raise to the nth power).
- And other more (As long as we know how to do it)
